# Calibration of the Top Cosmic Ray Tagger in ICARUS

## Abstract
The ICARUS detector, a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC), is taking data at Fermilab on the Booster's neutrino beam.
Being located at ground level, the TPC is exposed to a high flux of cosmic muons, whose signal constitutes a background in the reconstruction of neutrino interactions. The rejection of the signal induced by the passage of cosmic rays in the TPC is possible thanks to the Cosmic Ray Tagger (CRT), an external subdetector divided into three subsystems: Top, Side and Bottom CRT. The following work focuses on the calibration of the Top CRT, consisting of 123 modules that act as hodoscopes using plastic scintillator bars. The readout of the light generated by the passage of a cosmic ray is carried out through Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs). The developed code has the following objectives:
- Estimate the pedestal (noise) and SiPM gain values of each Top CRT channel;
- Develop the analysis and implement it in icaruscode , integrating it with the experiment pipeline.
The analysis campaign, in the CRT raw data decoding stage, runs on the files produced through the Production Operations Management System (POMS). This software allows to launch, modify and monitor large scale campaigns of data processing jobs and for an effective calibration, the analysis of at least 50k events is needed (~10 mln CRT hits).
